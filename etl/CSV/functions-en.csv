ABS|A mathematical function that returns the absolute (positive) value of the specified numeric expression. (`ABS` changes negative values to positive values. `ABS` has no effect on zero or positive values.)
ACOS|A function that returns the angle, in radians, whose cosine is the specified float expression. This is also called arccosine.
Aggregate|An aggregate function performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single value. Except for `COUNT(*)`, aggregate functions ignore null values. Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement.
Analytic|SQL Server supports these analytic functions:

APPLOCK_MODE|This function returns the lock mode held by the lock owner on a particular application resource. As an application lock function, APPLOCK_MODE operates on the current database. The database is the scope of the application locks.
APPLOCK_TEST|This function returns information as to whether or not a lock can be granted on a particular application resource, for a specified lock owner, without acquisition of the lock. As an application lock function, APPLOCK_TEST operates on the current database. The database is the scope of the application locks.
APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT|This function returns the approximate number of unique non-null values in a group.
APPROX_PERCENTILE_CONT|This function returns an approximate interpolated value from the set of values in a group based on percentile value and sort specification. Since this is an approximate function, the output would be within rank based error bound with certain confidence. The percentile value returned by this function is based on a continuous distribution of the column values and the result would be interpolated. Due to this, the output might not be one of values in the data set. One of the common use cases for this function is to avoid the data outliers. This function can be used as an alternative to PERCENTILE_CONT for large datasets where negligible error with faster response is acceptable as compared to accurate percentile value with slow response time.
APPROX_PERCENTILE_DISC|This function returns the value from the set of values in a group based on the provided percentile and sort specification. Since this is an approximate function, the output would be within rank based error bound with certain confidence. As this approximate percentile is based on a discrete distribution of the column values, the output value would be equal to one of the specific values in the column. This function can be used as an alternative to PERCENTILE_DISC for large datasets where negligible error with faster response is acceptable as compared to accurate percentile value with slow response time.

After restarting Windows, the GUID can start again from a lower range, but is still globally unique. When a GUID column is used as a row identifier, using NEWSEQUENTIALID can be faster than using the NEWID function. This is because the NEWID function causes random activity and uses fewer cached data pages. Using NEWSEQUENTIALID also helps to completely fill the data and index pages.

Since **OPENJSON** returns a set of rows, you can use **OPENJSON** in the `FROM` clause of a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement just as you can use any other table, view, or table-valued function.
OPENQUERY|Executes the specified pass-through query on the specified linked server. This server is an OLE DB data source. OPENQUERY can be referenced in the FROM clause of a query as if it were a table name. OPENQUERY can also be referenced as the target table of an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. This is subject to the capabilities of the OLE DB provider. Although the query may return multiple result sets, OPENQUERY returns only the first one.
OPENROWSET|Includes all connection information that is required to access remote data from an OLE DB data source. This method is an alternative to accessing tables in a linked server and is a one-time, ad hoc method of connecting and accessing remote data by using OLE DB. For more frequent references to OLE DB data sources, use linked servers instead. For more information, see [Linked Servers &#40;Database Engine&#41;](../../relational-databases/linked-servers/linked-servers-database-engine.md). The `OPENROWSET` function can be referenced in the FROM clause of a query as if it were a table name. The `OPENROWSET` function can also be referenced as the target table of an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement, subject to the capabilities of the OLE DB provider. Although the query might return multiple result sets, `OPENROWSET` returns only the first one.
OPENXML|OPENXML provides a rowset view over an XML document. Because OPENXML is a rowset provider, OPENXML can be used in [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements in which rowset providers such as a table, view, or the OPENROWSET function can appear.
@@OPTIONS|Returns information about the current SET options.
ORIGINAL_DB_NAME|Returns the database name specified by the user in the database connection string. This database is specified by using the **sqlcmd-d** option (USE *database*). It can also be specified with the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) data source expression (initial catalog =*databasename*).

PERCENT_RANK|Calculates the relative rank of a row within a group of rows in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Use PERCENT_RANK to evaluate the relative standing of a value within a query result set or partition. PERCENT_RANK is similar to the CUME_DIST function.
PERCENTILE_CONT|Calculates a percentile based on a continuous distribution of the column value in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The result is interpolated and might not be equal to any of the specific values in the column.
PERCENTILE_DISC|Computes a specific percentile for sorted values in an entire rowset or within a rowset's distinct partitions in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For a given percentile value *P*, PERCENTILE_DISC sorts the expression values in the ORDER BY clause. It then returns the value with the smallest CUME_DIST value given (with respect to the same sort specification) that is greater than or equal to *P*. For example, PERCENTILE_DISC (0.5) will compute the 50th percentile (that is, the median) of an expression. PERCENTILE_DISC calculates the percentile based on a discrete distribution of the column values. The result is equal to a specific column value.
PERMISSIONS|Returns a value containing a bitmap that indicates the statement, object, or column permissions of the current user.
